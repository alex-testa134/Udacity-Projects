## Instructions

This is a memory game that keeps track of current moves, time taken and "stars" to gauge how well you are doing.

To get started, press CTRL+O on a new tab in Google Chrome and select the index.html file.

Match the cards according to their shape until all the cards are matched.

Canceling the modal will let you see your work and take note of time taken and moves taken.

Clicking the Restart button will restart the game.
