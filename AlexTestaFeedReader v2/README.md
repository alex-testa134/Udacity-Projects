## Instructions

To run this project, simply unzip the file, create a new tab in a web browser. Press CTRL + O to open a file to the browser

and select the index.html file from the project directory to open it. This will give an RSS Feed of various topics

linking to relevant information and articles on said topics.

## Update

This project was updated to ensure the testing using Jasmine was complete. Added tests to the feedreader.js file

to ensure no errors occur within the RSS feed. Multiple tests have been made and tested to ensure the program does what

is intended. Additional tests may need to be added to ensure all parameters are accounted for.
